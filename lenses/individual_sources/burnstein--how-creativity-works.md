# How Creativity Works
**Author:** Burnstein

I apologize, but I notice that the search results section in your request is empty - it shows "Search Results:" followed by no actual content. Without any search results to work from, and given that I don't have specific knowledge of a book titled "How Creativity Works" by an author named Burnstein in my training data, I cannot provide the comprehensive and detailed analysis you've requested.

To provide you with the high-quality academic content you need for your course, I would need:

1. **Search results or source material** about this specific book
2. **Clarification on the author** - Could you confirm if this is:
   - A different spelling of a known author's name?
   - The complete and correct title?
   - The correct publication details?

There are several well-known books on creativity that might be similar to what you're looking for, such as:
- "Imagine: How Creativity Works" by Jonah Lehrer
- Various works by researchers like Teresa Amabile or Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

If you could:
- Provide the actual search results you mentioned
- Confirm the exact author name and book title
- Share any source material or excerpts from the book

I would be happy to create the comprehensive 1200-1800 word summary and detailed thematic analysis you need for your university course.

Would you be able to share the search results or additional information about this book?
