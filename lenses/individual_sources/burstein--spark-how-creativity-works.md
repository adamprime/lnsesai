# Spark How Creativity Works
**Author:** Burstein

**Tags:** Thinking, Creativity

I notice there's a discrepancy in your request. The search results show "Spark How Creativity Works" by Kurt Andersen, but you've referenced it as being by "Burstein" in your question. Based on the search results provided, I can only see limited information about a book related to Studio 360 and pop culture.

However, the search results are quite limited and don't provide sufficient detail about the book's content, themes, or key concepts to create the comprehensive 600-800 word summary and detailed theme analysis you've requested.

To provide you with an accurate and comprehensive analysis, I would need:
- More detailed search results about the book's content
- Information about the book's chapters and main arguments
- Examples of the creativity frameworks discussed
- Details about the author's research and methodology

## Summary
Based on the limited search results available, I cannot provide the detailed 600-800 word summary requested, as the search results only mention that this appears to be connected to Studio 360, a Peabody Award-winning guide to pop culture and the arts produced by Public Radio.

## Theme Analysis
Without sufficient information from the search results about the book's actual content, I cannot accurately identify and analyze 4-6 major themes as requested.

I recommend providing more comprehensive search results or additional source material about the book to enable a proper analysis of its content, key concepts, and themes related to how creativity works.
