## Summary

"What's Your Problem?: To Solve Your Toughest Problems, Change the Problems You Solve" by Thomas Wedell-Wedellsborg presents a revolutionary approach to problem-solving that challenges our fundamental assumptions about how we tackle difficult challenges. The book's central thesis is that most people and organizations fail not because they can't solve problems, but because they're solving the wrong problems entirely.

Wedell-Wedellsborg argues that we live in a world obsessed with solutions, rushing to fix issues before properly understanding what we're actually trying to solve. This "solution bias" leads to wasted resources, missed opportunities, and persistent problems that never truly get resolved. The author makes a compelling case that the key to breakthrough problem-solving lies not in becoming better at finding solutions, but in becoming better at finding the right problems to solve.

The book introduces the concept of "problem reframing" as a systematic approach to stepping back and questioning whether we're addressing the real issue. Rather than accepting problems as they're initially presented, Wedell-Wedellsborg advocates for a more thoughtful, deliberate process of problem definition. This involves examining our assumptions, considering multiple perspectives, and often discovering that the problem we thought we were facing is actually a symptom of something deeper or entirely different.

One of the book's key frameworks is the idea that problems exist in a hierarchy, and we often get stuck solving problems at the wrong level. Surface-level problems are symptoms of deeper systemic issues, and addressing only the symptoms ensures that problems will continue to resurface. The author provides practical tools for drilling down to root causes and, equally importantly, for zooming out to see bigger-picture opportunities that might be hidden by our narrow problem definitions.

Wedell-Wedellsborg emphasizes the importance of involving diverse perspectives in problem definition. He argues that our individual viewpoints and expertise can actually blind us to alternative ways of framing challenges. By bringing in different stakeholders and encouraging them to articulate how they see the problem, we can uncover new angles and possibilities that wouldn't be visible from a single perspective.

The book also addresses the organizational and psychological barriers that prevent effective problem reframing. Time pressure, hierarchical structures, and cognitive biases all conspire to push us toward quick fixes rather than thoughtful problem analysis. Wedell-Wedellsborg provides strategies for overcoming these obstacles and creating environments where better problem definition can flourish.

Throughout the work, the author illustrates his concepts with real-world examples from business, healthcare, education, and other domains. These case studies demonstrate how reframing problems can lead to breakthrough innovations and solutions that seemed impossible when working with the original problem definition. The examples show that this approach isn't just theoretical but has practical applications across industries and contexts.

The book's significance lies in its potential to transform how individuals and organizations approach their most challenging issues. In an era of rapid change and complex problems, the ability to step back and question our problem definitions becomes a crucial competitive advantage. Wedell-Wedellsborg's approach offers a systematic way to develop this capability, providing tools and frameworks that can be applied immediately.

The author's background in innovation consulting brings credibility to his arguments, and his writing style makes complex concepts accessible to a broad audience. The book serves as both a wake-up call about our problem-solving blind spots and a practical guide for developing better problem-solving capabilities.

Ultimately, "What's Your Problem?" suggests that the superpower of the 21st century isn't solving problems faster or more efficiently—it's solving better problems. By changing the problems we solve, we can unlock solutions that were previously invisible and create breakthrough results that seemed impossible under our original problem definitions.

## Theme Analysis

### Theme 1: Solution Bias and Premature Problem-Solving
**Explanation:** The book identifies our tendency to rush toward solutions before fully understanding the problem as a fundamental flaw in human problem-solving. This bias prevents us from discovering better problems to solve and leads to ineffective solutions.
**Examples:** Wedell-Wedellsborg shows how organizations often implement quick fixes that address symptoms rather than root causes, leading to recurring issues and wasted resources.

### Theme 2: Problem Reframing as a Systematic Process
**Explanation:** Rather than accepting problems as initially presented, the author advocates for a deliberate process of questioning and redefining problems. This systematic approach can reveal entirely new ways of thinking about challenges.
**Examples:** The book provides frameworks and tools for systematically examining problem definitions, including techniques for questioning assumptions and exploring alternative framings.

### Theme 3: The Problem Hierarchy and Root Cause Analysis
**Explanation:** Problems exist at different levels, from surface symptoms to deep systemic issues. Effective problem-solving requires identifying the right level to address and often involves drilling down to root causes or zooming out to see bigger patterns.
**Examples:** Case studies demonstrate how apparent problems are often symptoms of deeper issues, and how addressing the right level can lead to more effective and lasting solutions.

### Theme 4: Diverse Perspectives in Problem Definition
**Explanation:** Individual viewpoints and expertise can create blind spots that prevent us from seeing alternative problem definitions. Involving multiple stakeholders with different perspectives is crucial for effective problem reframing.
**Examples:** The author shows how bringing together diverse voices can reveal new angles on problems and uncover opportunities that weren't visible from a single perspective.

### Theme 5: Organizational and Psychological Barriers
**Explanation:** Various factors including time pressure, hierarchical structures, and cognitive biases work against thoughtful problem definition. Understanding and addressing these barriers is essential for implementing better problem-solving approaches.
**Examples:** The book explores how organizational culture and individual psychology can push us toward quick fixes and provides strategies for creating environments that support better problem definition.

### Theme 6: Innovation Through Problem Redefinition
**Explanation:** Many breakthrough innovations come not from better solutions to existing problems, but from redefining what problem needs to be solved. This reframing can unlock previously invisible opportunities and solutions.
**Examples:** Real-world case studies across industries demonstrate how reframing problems has led to innovative solutions and competitive advantages that weren't possible under original problem definitions.
