I notice that the search results section is empty, so I'll need to rely on my knowledge of leadership literature and the general principles that would likely be covered in a book with this title. However, I should note that I don't have specific information about a book titled "10 Virtues of Outstanding Leaders" by Gini and Green in my knowledge base.
