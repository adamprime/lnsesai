# LensShift Platform

A platform-agnostic knowledge lens service that enables users to generate custom, AI-ready context packages from curated business book and article content.

## Overview

LensShift allows users to:
1. Browse pre-built knowledge lenses (curated collections on topics like Feedback, Leadership, Coaching)
2. Generate custom lenses via a chat interface that assembles relevant content for their specific situation
3. Copy the compiled lens and paste it into any AI chat (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, etc.)
